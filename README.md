## 🆕 Phase 2 Additions

The platform was extended with five major capability upgrades focused on **hands-free interaction**, **peer-to-peer commerce**, **vision-based quality assurance**, **logistics intelligence**, and **hardened security**.

### 🎤 1. Voice Input (Web Speech API)
| Aspect | Implementation |
|--------|----------------|
| **API** | `window.SpeechRecognition` / `webkitSpeechRecognition` |
| **Location** | `Mic` toggle button inside `AIAssistant.tsx` floating chat |
| **Language** | `lang = en-IN` (Indian English accent tuned) |
| **Behavior** | Live transcription → auto-submits to AI agent on final result |
| **Fallback** | Gracefully hidden if browser does not support the API |
| **Use Case** | Farmers with low literacy can speak commands like *"List 50 kg organic tomatoes at ₹40/kg"* |

### 🚜 2. Equipment Rental Marketplace
| Aspect | Implementation |
|--------|----------------|
| **Route** | `/farmer/equipment` → `EquipmentRentalPage.tsx` |
| **Tables** | `equipment_rentals` (listings) + `equipment_bookings` (date-range reservations) |
| **Categories** | Tractor, Harvester, Plough, Sprayer, Irrigation, Other |
| **Pricing** | Daily rate × number of days = `total_cost` (auto-computed) |
| **Flow** | Owner lists equipment → other farmers search/filter → book with start/end dates |
| **RLS** | Owners manage their own listings; renters can only see/insert their own bookings |
| **UI** | Search bar, category `Select`, animated cards (Framer Motion), dual `Dialog` modals for list/book |

### ✅ 3. AI Quality Grading (Vision)
| Aspect | Implementation |
|--------|----------------|
| **Route** | `/farmer/quality` → `QualityGradingPage.tsx` |
| **Edge Function** | `quality-analysis` |
| **Model** | Google Gemini 2.5 Flash (Vision) via Lovable AI Gateway |
| **Input** | Base64 image (camera capture supported via `capture="environment"`) |
| **Output (JSON)** | `qualityScore`, `grade (A+/A/B/C)`, `freshness`, `appearance`, `defects[]`, `strengths[]`, `improvements[]`, `marketablePricing`, `verificationBadge`, `summary` |
| **Business Value** | Farmers get an instant **verified quality badge** + suggested market price before listing produce |
| **Error Handling** | Maps `429` (rate limit) and `402` (credits) to friendly toasts |

### 🔄 4. Farmer-to-Farmer Direct Trading
| Aspect | Implementation |
|--------|----------------|
| **Route** | `/farmer/trading` → `TradingPage.tsx` |
| **Table** | `farmer_trades` (with **Supabase Realtime** enabled) |
| **Tabs** | *Marketplace* (open trades from other farmers) / *My Trades* (owned listings) |
| **Flow** | Seller creates trade (product, qty, unit, price/unit → auto `total_price`) → other farmers click **Accept Trade** → `buyer_id` set + status `accepted` |
| **Statuses** | `open` → `accepted` → `completed` / `cancelled` |
| **Why It Matters** | Cuts out middlemen — farmers trade seeds, surplus produce, or inputs directly |

### 🗺️ 5. Multi-Stop Route Optimization
| Aspect | Implementation |
|--------|----------------|
| **Location** | `ActiveOrdersPage.tsx` (delivery dashboard) |
| **Algorithm** | **Nearest-Neighbor** heuristic over `RoutePoint[]` from current driver GPS |
| **Trigger** | "Optimize Route" button appears when driver has **2+ active orders** and known location |
| **Result** | Reorders pending stops to minimize total drive distance; map polyline + `TurnByTurnDirections` re-render automatically |
| **Pairs With** | OpenRouteService routing + Supabase Realtime GPS broadcast |

---

## 🔒 Security Hardening (Phase 2)

A full security scan was run and **all 7 findings were resolved**:

| Issue | Fix |
|-------|-----|
| **Privilege escalation via self-registration** | Added `ALLOWED_ROLES` whitelist in `auth-register` Edge Function — `admin` role can never be self-assigned |
| **Spoofable AI agent identity** | `ai-agent` no longer trusts `userId` from request body. It now derives identity server-side via `supabaseAuth.auth.getClaims(token)` from the JWT |
| **Client passing user IDs** | `useAIAgent.ts` now sends the session `access_token` as a `Bearer` header instead of a body field |
| **`user_roles` admin insert** | New RLS policy: `WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = user_id AND role <> 'admin')` |
| **Delivery partner order tampering** | `orders` UPDATE policy now restricts delivery partners to only their **assigned** orders via `WITH CHECK` |
| **Leaked-password reuse** | Enabled **HIBP (Have I Been Pwned)** leaked-password protection in Supabase Auth |
| **Edge function CORS / auth checks** | All Phase 2 functions validate `Authorization: Bearer ...` before processing |
